# TransAPEX
Fully translate Oracle APEX ( >= version 5.1 ) applications from within APEX.
Trans APEX is an APEX application that enables you to keep track of translation process in APEX - create projects containing multiple languages, automatically translate the texts using translation services (eg. Google Translator), review them and translate unique strings instead of multiple occurrences of the same text within an application.
